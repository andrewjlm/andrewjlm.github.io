I wrote a review of a recent performance of Gustav Holst's *The Planets* for a local Athens publication. The Hugh Hodgson School of Music puts on a great show and I'm excited to see something else there soon. You can read it over [here](http://www.thebroadcollective.com/holsts-planets-hugh-hodgson-hall/).
